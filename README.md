* Verify that the "node_modules" folder now exists in your files.

* Before using the program, delete any files that already exist with the name "README.md".

## **Usage**
* Type the following into your console:
```
node index.js
```
* After that, follow the instructions on your console to create your readme file. Ensure you save each file that opens in your text editor, else the program does not continue and you will have to reopen your editor and type "node index.js" again to start over.

* When you follow all of the instructions in the console, you can open your new README.md file, which should look something like this:

## **Questions**
### **Why does my program refuse to continue?** *****
The answer is that you most likely didn't save your file in your text editor, therefore you will have to start over again unless you can find the tmp file the program is looking for.
